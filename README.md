# morning-step
creating accountability for myself with each day starting with a step that i want to take

todo:
two states based on time: 2pm-6am, able to set a morning task
6am-2pm, able to complete a morning task
completing a morning task means incrementing a counter. wohoo.

create server
use redis key-value storage
send email each morning with reminder

this is a proof of concep, so i'm using https://keyvalue.xyz/ instead of rolling my own server.
